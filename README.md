# Playing For Kicks Website

This repository contains the code to run the Playing For Kicks website via GitHub Pages

## Editing the website

### Navigation

The navigation items are contained in `_data/navigation.yml`

### Gigs

Dates are in index.md

### Gallery

Update the _data/gallery.yml file
Be careful to keep the indents as they are in the file
Be careful to close quotes

The images will show in the order encountered in file, not number order, so just put a new one at the top
(The numbers don't actually matter as long as they are all different)

Add pictures to the assets/images/gigs directory (on the branch you are working on - or directly on the gh-pages branch)
Videos can now be added to the assets/video directory, though the new version of the page that uses them for the gallery isn't live yet.
